#DS1
#Set 4

#1. Write a function, called median,
#that will take in a list of numbers
#and then calculate and return the median of the list.
#The function should not change the list that is passed into it.
#Remember:  median of a list with an odd number of elements
#is the middle element of the sorted list; median of a list with
#an even number of elements
#is the average of the two middle elements of the sorted list.

#start median()

def median(aList):
    """ This function will calculate the median of a list. """

    #Create a new List sorted
    newList = sorted(aList)

    #If statement for even and odd numbers of list
    #length variable
    length = len(newList)

    #If the list has an even number of elements
    if length %2 == 0:

        #Take the middle number of the sorted list
        medianNum = (newList[length//2])
    
    #Else the list has an odd number of elements
    else:

        #Find the middle position
        middleIndex = length//2

        #Get the first middle number
        middle1 = newList[middleIndex]

        #Get the second middle number
        middle2 = middle1 + 1

        #Find the average
        medianNum = (middle1 + middle2) / 2

    return medianNum
#end median()


#Testing median function
myList = [1, 23, 5, 89, 789, 45]
myList2 = [1, 23, 5, 89, 789, 45 , 46 ]

#2. Nickname Generator
#Create a list of nickNames like:
#“the Enforcer”, “the Mad Scientist”, etc
#Ask the user for their first and last name.
#Then generate a nickname using: firstName, nickName,
#lastName by selecting a random nickName from the list.
#(eg.  John ‘the Enforcer’ Smith )
#Extension:  Add a program loop to allow the user to
#continue generating unique random nicknames until there are no nicknames left.
